Notes taken from all the books, articles lectures and interviews I've come across

### On Morality

A stoic idea - there's no good or bad, it's only our interpretations.

Morality is a grey area. 


### On Money

Money is an amazing thing, it enables people to put their time in ideas that don't have a short-term value. Money buys you freedom, however people sell their freedom to make money. {Ryan Holiday - Impact Theory}


### On Decisions and Thinking

What would a more humble person than me learn from this moment? {Ryan Holiday - Ego Is The Enemy}

How would an impartial person think about this? 

While humans act impulsively on many things - the ability to think between a stimulus and your response to it is rare, a competitive edge over your peers in daily life. 

Let the truth make decisions instead of your ego.{Ryan Holiday - Impact Theory}

When people say you're wrong, they're almost always right but when they explain why you're wrong, they're almost always wrong. However when you ignore them and do it anyway and it turns out right, you've learned a dangerous lesson. There's some delay between what you do and the consequences of your actions.{Ryan Holiday - Impact Theory}


### Misc

Don't do stuff just because you're supposed to. 

### Growth

A close friend of mine is the CXO of a startup that is aggressively expanding. Over dinner one day, I was feeling incredibly proud of how well he is doing. I congratulated him, and said “Man, how does it feel to be running such a high growth company?”
Pat came his reply, with a smile “It’s uncomfortable”
I was puzzled with his response, and enquired why - “One thing I have learnt is that we have to wake up everyday and do something that is extremely hard in the market - if we do the easy stuff, we will not create any value.
It’s an uncomfortable situation, dealing with new and difficult things. But that’s exactly why clients come to us - because we have got so good at solving hard problems and creating value. We thrive in the uncomfortable.”
It’s incredible, but your life is just like a startup - especially when you’re young. Applying the same logic to personal growth yields exactly the same results - always challenge yourself to do difficult things.
To grow, you must thrive in the discomfort of doing difficult things.
